## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to analyze data collected by the [Modern Language Association](https://www.mla.org/) on foreign language enrollments for the past two decades, with a view to comparing the [University of Oklahoma](https://ou.edu/) public institutions that are members of the [Association of American Universities](https://www.aau.edu/).

## Data
